# SECURITY

The information stored in our servers is very important and needs to be protected from hackers and other individuals who may want to steal the data. To accomplish this, we have compiled some recommendations that can be very helpful in securing our servers.

## CHANGE THE PORT FROM SSH

By default, SSH uses port 22, which is often the first port that attackers will target. To mitigate this risk, we recommend changing the default SSH port to a different port.
